## What Is TastyFactory?
TastyFactory is a 3d factory automation game, where players will work to create an increasingly complex food factory while protecting it against mishaps and disasters that will work against them. The game blends the satisfaction of creating an optimized system in games like satisfactory with the simplified, approachable look as well as the simple yet addictive gameplay of games like mini motorways.

## [Design Pillars](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/fourteen-forms-of-fun)
| **Problem Solving** | **Creation** | **Advancement and Completion** |
|---|---|---|
| Players should find pleasure in creating efficient solutions to most efficiently generate food to sell and thus money to grow their factory | Players should enjoy the feeling of creating their own factory from nothing and they should feel a sense of ownership over their factory, the game should not lead them in any one direction | Players should feel a sense of progression from unlocking more machines as well as seeing their factory grow bigger and bigger like in [Kingdoms and Castles](https://store.steampowered.com/app/569480/Kingdoms_and_Castles/) |
## Core Gameplay
The player starts off with an empty open environment in which they can place down their *depot* near a road, from which they will receive and send goods
Food if left outside to the environment for too long may go bad or have other adverse effects
Different *environments* may provide benefits to some systems while negatively affecting others, eg: a hot area, denoted by a  more redsih color, ![image.png](../assets/image_1733699608864_0.png){:height 172, width 400}
maybe like the top left corner here.
They will start out with limited factory equipment which they will be able to use to create a basic production line starting and ending at the depot.
Different factory equipment and elements will work together to create a cohesive system: _blue^^blue underline^^ denotes extended functionality that is not strictly necessary
*conveyor belts* will transport items in a single direction, can be connected to other equipment and the depot
*oven* will transform uncooked food into the cooked counterpart
*plater / combiner* will add a covering / seal onto plates / boxes to prepare them for sendoff, maybe also reduce spoiling, think of a bento box

*packager* will add a protective film or covering to the food to both ready it for return at the depot and increase the time before spoilage
_blue^^*transporters*^^ similar to depots transporters allow players to send different goods to other sub factories via a *shuttle* so that players don't have to keep their factory in one region and can take advantage of other *regions*
Other systems and equipment can be explored to tune the **fun** of the game #prototyping
## Gameplay Balance
The player should be *incentivised to re-create* their factory at some point, to lay it out better so it becomes more efficient. Games like mini motorways and satisfactory do this without explicitly telling the player to not let the game become boring and allow the player to fall into a rhythm
One way this could potentially be accomplished is by allowing the player to access *higher tiered equipment* so they may have to tear down existing infrastructure and rebuild
## Art Style and Aesthetics
Overall it should be a minimalist art style similar to [kenny's assets](https://www.kenney.nl/assets), keeping a clean and minimalist UI
Colors should easily indicate the tier of equipment, better gear looks more satisfying and impressive, **juice juice juice!**
Pastel aesthetics like mini motorways
## Setting and World
The world should be procedural generated with environmental constraints like rivers and mountians represented in a similar style to [mini motorways](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1127500/Mini_Motorways/), the road network needs to be prominent to allow players to connect their factory to a depot at more locations

## Business Model
Sometime around the first playtest with my friends I should make the first devlog video on yt explaining the premise and where to go from there
Release demo at some point
Continue devlogs until release on steam for around $10
