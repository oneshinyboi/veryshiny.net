The game blends the satisfaction of creating an optimized system in games like satisfactory with the simplified, approachable look as well as the simple yet addictive gameplay of games like mini motorways.\n+ + Design Pillars # Problem Solving Creation Advancement and Completion Players should find pleasure in creating efficient solutions to most efficiently generate food to sell and thus money to grow their factory Players should enjoy the feeling of creating their own factory from nothing and they should feel a sense of ownership over their factory, the game should not lead them in any one direction Players should feel a sense of progression from unlocking more machines as well as seeing their factory grow bigger and bigger like in Kingdoms and Castles Core Gameplay # The player starts off with an empty open environment in which they can place down their depot near a road, from which they will receive and send goods Food if left outside to the environment for too long may go bad or have other adverse effects Different environments may provide benefits to some systems while negatively affecting others, eg: a hot area, denoted by a more redsih color, {:height 172, width 400} maybe like the top left corner here. They will start out with limited factory equipment which they will be able to use to create a basic production line starting and ending at the depot. Different factory equipment and elements will work together to create a cohesive system: _blue^^blue underline^^ denotes extended functionality that is not strictly necessary conveyor belts will transport items in a single direction, can be connected to other equipment and the depot oven will transform uncooked food into the cooked counterpart plater / combiner will add a covering / seal onto plates / boxes to prepare them for sendoff, maybe also reduce spoiling, think of a bento box {:height 172, width 200} packager will add a protective film or covering to the food to both ready it for return at the depot and increase the time before spoilage _blue^^transporters^^ similar to depots transporters allow players to send different goods to other sub factories via a shuttle so that players don\u0026rsquo;t have to keep their factory in one region and can take advantage of other regions Other systems and equipment can be explored to tune the fun of the game #prototyping\nGameplay Balance # The player should be incentivised to re-create their factory at some point, to lay it out better so it becomes more efficient. Games like mini motorways and satisfactory do this without explicitly telling the player to not let the game become boring and allow the player to fall into a rhythm One way this could potentially be accomplished is by allowing the player to access higher tiered equipment so they may have to tear down existing infrastructure and rebuild\nArt Style and Aesthetics # Overall it should be a minimalist art style similar to kenny\u0026rsquo;s assets, keeping a clean and minimalist UI Colors should easily indicate the tier of equipment, better gear looks more satisfying and impressive, juice juice juice! Pastel aesthetics like mini motorways\nSetting and World # The world should be procedural generated with environmental constraints like rivers and mountians represented in a similar style to mini motorways, the road network needs to be prominent to allow players to connect their factory to a depot at more locations drawio\nBusiness Model # Sometime around the first playtest with my friends I should make the first devlog video on yt explaining the premise and where to go from there Release demo at some point Continue devlogs until release on steam for around $10\n","date":"11 December 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tastyfactorydesigndocument/","section":"Blowfish","summary":"What Is TastyFactory?","title":"TastyFactory","type":"page"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"}]
