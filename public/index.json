The game blends the satisfaction of creating an optimized system in games like satisfactory with the simplified, approachable look as well as the simple yet addictive gameplay of games like mini motorways. Previous Nextsads Design Pillars # Problem Solving Creation Advancement and Completion Players should find pleasure in creating efficient solutions to generate food to sell and thus money to grow their factory Players should enjoy the feeling of creating their own factory from nothing and they should feel a sense of pride over their factory, the game should not lead them in any one direction Players should feel a sense of progression from unlocking more machines as well as seeing their factory grow bigger and bigger like in Kingdoms and Castles Core Gameplay # The player starts off with an empty open environment in which they can place down their depot near a road, from which they will receive and send goods.\nFood if left outside to the environment for too long may go bad or have other adverse effects.\nDifferent environments may provide benefits to some systems while negatively affecting others. an example of different coloured environments Players will start out with limited factory equipment which they will be able to use to create a basic production line starting and ending at the depot.\nDifferent factory equipment and elements will work together to create a cohesive system:\nconveyor belts will transport items in a single direction, can be connected to other equipment and the depot ovens will transform uncooked food into the cooked counterpart combiners will take many forms, from mixers to platers and other cooking equipment, but at their core they take one item and combine it with another packagers will add a protective film or covering to the food to ready it for return at the depot and increase the time before spoilage un-packagers will remove the protective film, useful for recieving food from another sub factory transporters similar to depots, transporters allow players to send different goods to other sub factories via a shuttle so players can take advantage of other regions Other systems and equipment can be explored to tune the fun of the game.\nGameplay Balance # The player should be incentivised to re-create their factory at some point, to lay it out better, so it becomes more efficient. Games like mini motorways and satisfactory do this by allowing the player to make a functional factory at first but they inevitably discover that it is not scaleable and are forced to rebuild.\nOne way this could potentially be accomplished is by ensuring there is a wide range of equipment and upgrades available, some of which will be situational so there will exist many ways to improve the factory by rearranging it.\nArt Style and Aesthetics # Overall it should be a minimalist art style, any further assets I make should keep in line with kenny\u0026rsquo;s assets which I am already using. For the UI, I like how shapez 2 looks, clean and modern with transparency and blur.\nThe main game should use a pastelly color scheme, yet it should pop to highlight important objects and work seamlessly together with the UI color scheme.\nSetting and World # The world should be procedurally generated with elements that require special consideration when building, such as rivers and mountians. The road network needs to be prominent, to allow players to connect their factory to a depot at more locations.
